# PROJECT_CONTEXT.md — TCHS Class of 2003 Reunion Website

Persistent context for multi-agent / multi-session collaboration.  
**Read this first** before any work session.

---

## 1. Objective

Build and deploy a polished, functional reunion website for TCHS Class of 2003's 25th reunion (2028). Success looks like:
- Complete info site with event details, RSVP flow, and photo gallery
- Mobile-responsive design with TCHS branding
- Working RSVP/registration system
- Venue and logistics information
- Accessible to ~200+ classmates

---

## 2. Current State

**Repo:** `mark-wittman/tchs-class-2003-reunion-2028`  
**Current artifact:** Single-page `index.html` with:
- Hero section with TCHS branding (navy/maroon/gold palette)
- Event agenda (Fri mixer, Sat main event, Sun brunch)
- Venue shortlist (Campbell House, Hilton, etc.)
- Yearbook archive section (placeholder for PDFs)
- RSVP stub (links to placeholder Google Form)

**Known gaps:**
- RSVP form link is `REPLACE_WITH_CLASS_FORM` placeholder
- Yearbook PDFs not yet scanned/uploaded
- Venue not locked, no booking confirmation
- Hotel block details not added
- No classmate directory or photo gallery

- [ ] Any logos/photos we have permission to use from TCHS?
- [ ] Venue booking timeline — when does a decision need to be made?
- [ ] Hotel block — is there a preferred partner hotel?
- [ ] Yearbook scans — who has physical yearbooks to scan?
- [ ] Domain name — staying on GitHub Pages or custom domain?
